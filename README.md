# DatabaseSystems-Project

The Salon Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline and automate various aspects of salon management. This system is built using a Microsoft SQL Server database for data storage, Qt Designer for the user interface, and PyQt6 and PyODBC to connect the front end with the database.

**Features**

**Master Transactions:** The system includes several master transactions, allowing users to efficiently manage key salon operations. These transactions cover areas such as customer management, employee management, inventory tracking, and appointment scheduling.

**MS SQL Server Database:** The data is stored in a Microsoft SQL Server database, providing a robust and scalable solution for data management. The use of a relational database ensures data integrity and enables efficient querying and reporting.

**Qt Designer UI:** The user interface is created using Qt Designer, a powerful tool for designing graphical user interfaces. The UI is intuitive, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing, providing a seamless experience for salon staff.

**PyQt6 and PyODBC Integration:** PyQt6 is used for creating the graphical user interface, and PyODBC is employed to establish a connection between the front end and the Microsoft SQL Server database. This integration ensures smooth communication between the user interface and the database, allowing for real-time data retrieval and updates.
